Beyond academics, I’ve had the opportunity to be involved in incredible programs, communities, and projects that have shaped my journey both personally and professionally.

## Organizations

I'm actively engaged in several tech communities that align with my values:
- **ColorStack** – Attended the first ColorStack IRL Summit in 2024  
- **Rewriting the Code (RTC)** – Empowering women in technology  
- **Society of Women Engineers (SWE)** – Advancing women in engineering  
- **Ignite AI4ALL** – Machine Learning Student (2024 cohort)  
- **National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT)** – Member and award recipient  
- **National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE)** – Supporting Black excellence in engineering and tech  

## Leadership

- **LeetCode Club President & Founder | Minnesota State University, Mankato**  
  Founded a LeetCode Club on campus to help students like myself prepare for technical interviews through peer practice, support, and accountability. I also maintain a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Meronats/LeetClub) that has resources such as resume templates, beginner books, and a job board for international students. I took on this initiative becasue I am passionate about accessiblity and want to be the resource I never had when I first started studying in college. 

- **Community Outreach Lead | ColorStack Chapter at MNSU**  
  I lead outreach initiatives to create opportunities and foster a sense of belonging for underrepresented students. I organize events, connect students to resources, and create pathways for meaningful engagement.

## Volunteer Work

- **Volunteer Teacher | Microsoft TEALS**  
  Taught introductory programming class to high school students from diverse backgrounds. I love mentoring young kids that are interested in tech. I loved having chats with my students about games and projects were working on. I truly saw my younger self in them and enjoyed every class. 

## Research and Hackathons

- **Research Assistant | MNSU Undergraduate Research Center**  
  *(January 2022 – May 2023)*  
  Conducted research on optimizing data transmission in optical communication systems. Presented findings at university-level research conferences.

- **3rd Place Winner | HackUTA 2023**  
  Participated in a 24-hour hackathon and developed a full-stack application to reduce food waste by tracking expiration dates and recipe suggestions.

## Programs
- **Fellow | Impact Labs**  
  Impact Labs is a selective program for young technologists who believe in using tech to drive social good. For a week, I lived in a hacker house and finally built a project I had been thinking about for a long time. I built *Radix* (Latin for “root”), a financial literacy application designed to support international students like myself. 


- **Graduate | NAB Technology Apprenticeship Program (TAP)**  
  The NAB TAP is a hands-on program that introduces emerging technologists to the broadcast and media industry. As a participant, I explored cloud-based systems like AWS and gained real-world experience in broadcast engineering. After graduating from this 6-month-long program, I successfully earned the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification. 


## Scholarships and Recognitions

- **Microsoft Cybersecurity Women in Cloud Scholarship Recipient**  
  Received scholarship and certification through a competitive program supporting women in cybersecurity.

- **Google ‘Mentor Me Collective’ Program Participant**  
  Selected for Google’s mentorship program scholarship focused on career development in project management and technical fields.

# Why These Experiences Matter

Each of these communities, programs, and achievements has helped me grow beyond technical skills. They’ve taught me leadership, collaboration, resilience, and how to turn passion into real-world impact.

I'm excited to keep building, learning, and giving back wherever I go.
