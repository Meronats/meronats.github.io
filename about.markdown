# Hi, I'm Meron Woldesenbet
I'm a Computer Science major with a Math minor, graduating in December 2025. Outside of coding, I love playing games, reading, and writing, they help me stay creative and balanced.

I'm currently looking for full-time/new grad opportunities in Software Engineering. I’m passionate about working on projects where I can see the real impact I have on people's lives. I also enjoy learning about infrastructure and diving into the customer experience side of products. My ideal role would combine:
- Hands-on software development
- Product strategy and innovation
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Social impact through technology
 
This summer (2025), I'm working as a Software Engineering Intern at Microsoft on the Security Management team, where I’m gaining valuable experience building secure, customer-focused solutions.


Thank you for visiting my portfolio website, and I look forward to engaging in meaningful conversations!
