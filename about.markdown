# Hi, I'm Meron Woldesenbet
I am a Computer Science major with a Minor in Math, set to graduate in December 2025. My passion for technology is driven by my love for solving problems. I enjoy tackling complex challenges, whether it's optimizing algorithms, designing user-friendly software, or enhancing systems' efficiency.

Beyond the keyboard, my hobbies, such as playing games, reading, and drawing provide me with a well-rounded perspective that complements my software engineering skills.

I'm always open to new opportunities and conversations. Whether it's about potential collaborations, internships, or simply discussing the latest tech trends, feel free to reach out.
Thank you for visiting my portfolio website!
