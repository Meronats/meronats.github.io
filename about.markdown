# Hi, I'm Meron Woldesenbet
I am a Computer Science major with a Minor in Math, set to graduate in December 2025. My passion for technology is driven by my love for solving problems. I enjoy tackling complex challenges, whether it's optimizing algorithms, designing user-friendly software, or enhancing systems' efficiency.

Beyond the keyboard, my hobbies, such as playing games, reading, and writing provide me with a well-rounded perspective that complements my software engineering skills.

I am currently actively seeking internship opportunities in the field of technology, with a particular interest in Product Management roles and Software Engineering. However, I am open to exploring opportunities in Technical Consulting, Cybersecurity, Machine Learning and Systems Engineering as well. My goal is to apply my computer science skills and mathematical background to real-world challenges, contributing to innovative solutions and gaining valuable industry experience. If you have any potential collaborations, internship openings, or if you'd like to discuss the latest tech trends, I would be thrilled to connect with you. 

Thank you for visiting my portfolio website, and I look forward to engaging in meaningful conversations and exciting opportunities!
