I believe the best way to learn is by doing, which is why I constantly challenge myself through personal side projects and collaborations. These projects keep me in a continuous learning loop, helping me sharpen my skills and stay curious.

Below are some of the projects that have shaped my journey and helped me grow into the developer I am today. Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested in collaborating or simply want to chat more about any of these experiences!
