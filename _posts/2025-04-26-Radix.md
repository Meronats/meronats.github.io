Interactive financial literacy platform for international students.

# Inspiration
As an international student myself, I saw firsthand how hard it can be to navigate financial systems in a new country. From credit scores to installment payments, so much is unfamiliar and the resources out there often feel overwhelming. I’m very passionate about making financial literacy easier to navigate, especially for students like me who are new to it all. 

# What it does
Radix is an interactive platform that teaches financial concepts through storytelling and real-life scenarios. It covers topics like:
- Credit scores and credit cards
- Budgeting and saving
- Managing bills and subscriptions
- Basics of investing and taxes


# How it is built
I built Radix in just one week as part of the **Impact Labs** program—a week-long innovation sprint held in San Francisco. Using Python, React, and Google’s Gemini API for natural language interactions, I created a chatbot-driven experience where students can learn and ask questions without feeling intimidated. I also created a community space (Slack) for ongoing support.


# What I learned
I deepened my skills in rapid prototyping, conversational design, and user experience (UX) for education. Most importantly, I learned how powerful it is to design with empathy thinking not just about what a tool *can* do, but how it *feels* to the person using it.

# Key Features
- Bite-sized, story-based lessons
- Interactive chatbot for financial questions
- Community support through Slack
- Accessible, friendly design

# Contributions
- Empowering international students to feel confident managing their finances
- Promoting financial inclusion and education
