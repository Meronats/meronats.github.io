Soccer Recruiting Application  


[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Meronats/TalentTrack)


# About the Project
Created Talent Track to help soccer coaches manage recruit emails in a more organized and efficient way. Coaches often receive dozens of emails a day from students, each formatted differently and hard to track. Our app makes the process smoother by automatically parsing emails and showing player information in a clean dashboard.

## The Problem

- Current method is completely manual
- Disorganized and hard to manage
- Coaches can‚Äôt remotely access info
- Potential recruits often fall through the cracks

---

## Solution

- Create an automated recruiting application
- Parse recruit emails using AI
- Store player data in a structured database
- Build an easy-to-use interface for coaches

---

- **Backend**: Python, Flask  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL  
- **Parsing & AI**: GPT-3.5 Turbo  
- **Cloud**: AWS

## Application Flow

1. üì© **Email is forwarded to TalentTrack inbox**  
   ‚Ü≥ The coach forwards recruit emails to a dedicated inbox.

   ‚Ü≥ Our backend checks the inbox and extracts relevant info (GPA, grad year, position, etc.).

3. üóÉÔ∏è **Parsed data is stored in a database**  
   ‚Ü≥ The extracted details are saved securely in PostgreSQL.

4. üñ•Ô∏è **View player dashboard in user interface**  
   ‚Ü≥ The coach can log into the app and view/update player info through a simple React-based UI.

## üß† What I Learned
This project helped me grow in both frontend and backend development. I gained hands-on experience working with email parsing, AI integration, cloud deployment, and teamwork under deadlines. I also learned how important clean UI and data structure are when building tools meant for real users.

## Impact
Talent Track helps coaches focus more on making the right recruiting decisions instead of drowning in unorganized emails. It brings clarity, automation, and structure to a process that really needed it.
