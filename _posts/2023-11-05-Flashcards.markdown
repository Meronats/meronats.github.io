# StudyShuffle
Introducing my latest creation, the StudyShuffle web app is a companion for efficient and engaging learning. With a unique Shuffle feature, StudyShuffle adds an element of surprise to your study sessions by randomizing flashcards, keeping your mind sharp and engaged. Take charge of your progress with customizable stacks, effortlessly moving conquered cards to a separate stack for focused revision. I used HTML/CSS for a seamless user interface. StudyShuffle isn't just a flashcard app; it's a personalized journey towards mastering your material with a touch of innovation.

When you interact with the flashcards by flipping them, you'll reveal definitions and answers on the reverse side. This feature is designed to provide a concise yet comprehensive understanding of the topic at hand, enhancing the learning experience. Moreover, each flashcard is thoughtfully equipped with a link positioned at the bottom. This link serves as a gateway for those Who want to learn more about the topic.
