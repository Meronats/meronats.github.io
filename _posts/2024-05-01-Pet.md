I love pets, and I believe every single one of them deserves a safe, loving home. Here is a system that helps get them there.



# About the Project

This project started from a simple idea: what if shelters had better tools to help pets find the right home—and stay there? I worked with a team to build a system that could handle everything from adoption tracking to post-adoption follow-ups, while also making it easier for staff to manage records across multiple locations.

We used **three different types of databases** to handle different parts of the workflow:
- **PostgreSQL** for structured adoption and user records  
- **MongoDB** for flexible health and behavior tracking  
- **Neo4j** for relationship-based pet recommendations (based on tags, preferences, and social circles)

# Why It Matters

This app helps shelters keep better records, suggest pets adopters are more likely to bond with, and stay connected with families long after adoption day. 

I was in awe the whole time I Was working with the data. It reinforced the idea that data can be emotional. It’s not just rows and queries—it’s stories, relationships, and lives made better with the right technology.

# What I Learned

I came away from this project with a deeper understanding of how to design systems that reflect real-world complexity. I also learned how different database models shine when used together—and how to keep things meaningful even when working with technical infrastructure.
